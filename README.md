**User Story**:\
A User story is used to describe one or more features of a product in Scrum project managment.  

A User story answers the following questions:
 -  who is the user?
 -  what features do they want?
 -  why do they want these features?

**Product backlog**:\
The product backlog is a list of items that should be done to complete the scrum project. it contains all the features, user stories, improvement, bug fixes that should be done for future releases.

**Sprint planning and Sprint backlog:**\
The plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire scrum team and the team determines the product backlog items 
they will work on during that sprint. 

The team break down each targeted features into a set of tasks. the collection of these tasks, along with their associated product backlog items, it will form a second backlog called the sprint backlog.

The spirint backlog is list of product backlog items that the scrum team can complete during a specific sprint

**Daily Scrum and The Sprint**:\
Daily scrum is a 15 mintue event for the developers of the scrum team, during the daily scrum you answer the 3 simple questions

The Questions are: 
1. What did I do yesterday?
2. What I will be doing today?
3. any blockers?

The scrum sprint is a fixed time period of 1-4 weeks. 

**Sprint team**:\
In scrum, cross-functional teams work together to finish the porjec. 

A Scrum team consists of:
1. Product owner: they have the vision for what the final product needs to be. they lead the scrum process and relay customer feedback to the team.
2. Scrum master: they ensure that the team follows the principles of the scrum framework
3. Developement team: a small, self-organizing a group of employees with a diverse skill set. the development team members can include UI/UX designers, graphic desingers, coders and writers.

**Sprint Review**:\
Sprint review is informal meeting and everyone in the scrum team (product owner, developement team, scrum master)
will attend and the team gives a demo on the product and it will determine whether the product is completed or incompleted. 

**Sprint Retrospective**\
after the sprint is completed, the scrum team holds sprint retrospective meeting to reivew the sprint. the team discuess what process went well and what could have been improved. these help the team analyze the bottlenecks faced and find solution for the next or future sprint.
